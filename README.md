# Funnel-Analysis-Challenge
The goal is to perform funnel analysis for an e-commerce website.

# Challenge Description

The company CEO isn't very happy with the volume of sales and, especially, of the sales coming from new users. Therefore, she asked you to investigate whether there is something wrong in the conversion funnel or, in general, if you could suggest how conversion rate can be improved.

## Specifically, she is interested in :
1. A full picture of funnel conversion rate for both desktop and mobile
2. Some insights on what the product team should focus on in order to improve conversion rate as well as anything you might discover that could help improve conversion rate.

# Data

We have 5 tables and the site has just 4 pages:

1. The ﬁrst page is the home page. When you come to the site for the ﬁrst time, you can only land on the home page as a ﬁrst page.
2. From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.
3. From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.
4. If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the conﬁrmation page
